## Wins
- Implementation of the core features, including the article list, detailed view, and search functionality.
- Responsive design that provides a seamless experience across different devices.
- Efficient data retrieval using the News API while considering the limitations on the number of requests.

## Challenges & Improvements

- Limited number of requests from the News API: During development, mock data was used to limit actual API requests. However, live requests are made during demonstration/evaluation to ensure the accuracy and freshness of the news articles.

- Time management: The project was completed within the allocated time frame of approximately 8 hours. However, due to time constraints, certain additional elements or improvements might have been omitted.
